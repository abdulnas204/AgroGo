# AgroGo

This app helps the farmers to convert from a food crop to a commercial crop by providing a full fledged cost and risk analysis.

With this project we aim to cater to the problem of exchange of crops between food and commercial for farmers in the country.

## Basic features : 
    Our app, primarily covers the basic cost analysis features for a crop change including the parameters like weather forecasting, season change, labour cost, machinery changes, fertilizer change etc.
    At the second stage, it provides different types of matrices for a multiple crop change procedure also. This will be covered for all categories of farmers i.e. small, medium, big landlords etc.
    At the third and final stage, it includes also the various brands of equipments discussed above that are available in the specific area and the best price options for an optimal cost reduction. There is a forum where farmers can build a community and discuss their problems. A helpline number is also provided for emergency/ guidance.

The app will provide a visual overlay with infographics to create an engaging user experience. The languages will be Hindi and English and along with a regional language support.

The constraints incurred by our app shall be the reduced availability of certain brands/ labour in a specific area, the fluctuating price range for crops and sudden weather calamity, if occurs.
